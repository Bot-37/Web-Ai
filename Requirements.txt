# This file lists the necessary Python packages required to run the Streamlit app.
# Follow the steps below to install the dependencies and set up your environment.

# Step 1: Ensure you have Python installed.
# The recommended version is Python 3.7 or higher. You can check your Python version by running:
# python --version

# Step 2: Install pip (Python's package installer) if you don't have it.
# You can install pip by following the instructions here: https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installation/

# Step 3: Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended).
# Creating a virtual environment ensures that your project dependencies are isolated.
# You can create a virtual environment by running:
# python -m venv myenv
# Activate the virtual environment:
# On Windows: .\myenv\Scripts\activate
# On macOS/Linux: source myenv/bin/activate

# Step 4: Install the required libraries by running:
# pip install -r requirements.txt
# This command will install all the libraries listed below.

# -------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Streamlit is a web application framework that allows you to create interactive
# and dynamic web applications with minimal effort. It is used in this project
# to build the user interface, handle user inputs, and display outputs.
streamlit==1.25.0

# google-generativeai is a Python library that provides an interface to interact
# with Google's Generative AI models, such as the Gemini model. This library is
# used in this project to send user queries to the AI model and receive responses.
google-generativeai==0.1.0

# -------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Additional dependencies can be added here if your project requires them in the future.

# Step 5: Run the Streamlit app.
# Once the libraries are installed, you can start the Streamlit app by running:
# streamlit run app.py
# Replace "app.py" with the actual name of your Python script file.
